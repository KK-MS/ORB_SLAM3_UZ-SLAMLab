# IMU Format

To use the IMU data in ORB_SLAM3 it needs to be prepared into a CSV file.
The name of the CSV file should have allways the same name.
The name of the file is: ```data.csv```.

## CSV Header

```
#timestamp [ns],w_RS_S_x [rad s^-1],w_RS_S_y [rad s^-1],w_RS_S_z [rad s^-1],a_RS_S_x [m s^-2],a_RS_S_y [m s^-2],a_RS_S_z [m s^-2]
```
